# How to setup your Neocities site for hosting server settings

under `botStuff/` add a file named `neocitiesSettings.json` formatted like so, adding your own site's details!

```json
{
    "name": "site-name",
    "pass": "passWord",
    "fullURL": "https://siteName.neocities.org/" // Remember, this does NOT have to be a neocities site, it can also be your owned domain if the files are still hosted by neocities!
}
```
