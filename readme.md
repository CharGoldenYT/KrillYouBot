# Usage

Launch the krillyou.exe thats generated by pyinstaller along with an accompanying `botKey.text` in the same folder as the EXE with a [VALID BOTKEY](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started)
like `XXXxxXXXXXXXXXXXxxxxxxxxXXXXXXXXX.xxxxxxxXXxxxXXXXXXXxxxxxxxXXXXxxXXxxxx` (why tf would i give you MY botkey lmao)

# Compiling:

> [!NOTE]
> The officially tested python versions are
>
> ***Pre 3.0:*** 3.12.4 -3.12.6
>
> ***Since 3.0:*** 3.12.6

you need [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and 3 libraries Found in [Setup.bat](setup.bat)

MAKE SURE TO SET THIS WHEN YOU INSTALL PYTHON!! ![](docs/IMPORTANT.png)

then simply run `build.bat` from the root of the repo with everything downloaded.

# Randomly common issues:

For some reason it'll occasionally fail to create a logs folder and crash, just simple make a logs folder where you put the EXE and it'll stop crashing as long as the main requirement of having a valid bot key is satisfied. (THIS HAS BEEN FIXED, BUT OLDER VERSIONS OF THE KRILL YOU BOT MIGHT HAVE THIS ISSUE, BEWARE!)
